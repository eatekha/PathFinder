# Pathfinder

Welcome to Pathfinder! This repository contains a Java application that helps you find the shortest path between two points on a map using various pathfinding algorithms.

## Installation

To use Pathfinder, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/eatekha/Pathfinder.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd Pathfinder
   ```

3. Compile the Java source files:

   ```
   javac Pathfinder.java
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```
   java Pathfinder
   ```

5. Start using Pathfinder to find the shortest paths on your map!

## Usage

Once Pathfinder is running, follow these steps to find the shortest path:

1. Upload your map: Click on the "Upload Map" button and select the file containing your map. The map file should be in the correct format, specifying the walls, start point, and end point.

2. Select the algorithm: Choose the desired pathfinding algorithm from the available options, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, A* algorithm, or any other algorithm implemented in the application.

3. Find the shortest path: Click on the "Find Path" button to calculate the shortest path based on the selected algorithm. The path will be displayed on the map, highlighting the nodes and edges that make up the shortest path.

4. Visualize and analyze: Use the visualization provided by Pathfinder to examine the shortest path and analyze the steps taken by the algorithm. Gain insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of different pathfinding algorithms.

## Customization

Pathfinder allows for customization and extension. You can modify the existing pathfinding algorithms or implement new ones to suit your needs. Explore the codebase and make changes accordingly.
